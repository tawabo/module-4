The method of Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

    Initially you will import the correct libariers from pandas to analyze the risk and return for the whales compared to SP 500
    
    
Time to get some data 

  We will start by getting some plots charted from the cumprod function and checking the end of the report plot theses charts to see where everyone stands.
  
Visualizing the data in a plot box function using the kind = "box" we can now see the volatility corresponding to each fund.

Due to high amounts of data you will want to run the rolling window function set to 21 days and retrieve the std dev.


It is good to diversify now we used the 60 day rolling function and found the mean using the mean function
